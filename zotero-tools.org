* Purpose: explore clojurescript and zotero-api-client simultaneously.
* Links
    * [[https://shadow-cljs.github.io/docs/UsersGuide.html][shadow-cljs user's guide]]
* About shadow-cljs
    * You can either ~compile~ or ~watch~.
* Building and running it
** Preliminary
  * ~npm init~ in the project directory. _I think_ you'll need to add
    - "zotero-api-client": "^0.40.0", 
    - "shadow-cljs": "^2.19.6",  
  * installed shadow-cljs globally ~npm install -g shadow-cljs~ so that I can run it easily from the command line.
** Build
    ~shadow-cljs compile-script~
** Run
    ~node target/script.js~
    It should return something like:
    
    "Hello world, again!"
